# Operation Queue System Implementation - Session Handover

**Date**: 2025-01-15
**Session**: operation-queue-system-15-01-2025a
**Previous Context**: User wanted to minimize page refreshes when editing blog posts in notepad

## Problem Statement

The Astro dev server watches `src/content/blog/` and auto-refreshes on any file change. This created jarring UX when:
- Saving blog posts
- Deleting blog posts
- Switching between posts

User wanted a queue system to batch all changes until manually pushed to disk.

## What Was Implemented ✅

### 1. OperationQueue Class
**File**: `src/pages/notepad.astro`
**Lines**: 1290-1524

A sophisticated queue system that:
- Stores operations in a Map (key: resourceId, value: latest operation)
- Intelligently deduplicates: save→save = latest only, create→delete = removed entirely
- Persists to sessionStorage for crash recovery
- Executes deletes before saves to prevent filename conflicts

### 2. Integration Points Modified

1. **queueBlogSave()** (lines 3465-3549)
   - Replaced direct API calls with queue.add()
   - Updates window.BLOG_POSTS immediately for visual feedback
   - No disk writes until push

2. **deleteBlogPost()** (lines 3383-3436)
   - No longer calls API directly
   - Adds delete operation to queue
   - Animates removal from DOM immediately

3. **executeQueueFlush()** (lines 3587-3646)
   - Executes all queued operations
   - Stores state for post-refresh restoration
   - Handles temp ID → real ID mapping

4. **Removed auto-saves** from:
   - loadNote (line 2057)
   - loadBlogPost (line 1845)
   - createNewBlogPost (line 3817)

### 3. UI Enhancements

- **Push button**: Shows count "Push Changes (3)" with tooltip
- **Color coding**: Orange at 3+ ops, Red at 5+ ops (lines 3563-3572)
- **Pending indicators**: Orange • on posts with pending changes (lines 1786-1793)
- **CSS**: Added button transitions and disabled state (lines 126-140)

## Critical Bug That Was Fixed

**Issue**: Server returned "null filename, 1 character content" error
**Root cause**: Queue was sending raw data but server expects full markdown with frontmatter
**Fix**: Added frontmatter generation to executeSave (lines 1478-1495)

The server expects:
```
---
title: "Post Title"
pubDate: 2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z
category: "uncategorized"
---

Content here
```

## Side Change: Category Selection UX

During testing, discovered a popup prompt for category selection on new posts. User hated it.
**Changed**: Removed prompt entirely (line 3884), now defaults to "uncategorized" and user changes in metadata field.

## Current State

- Queue system fully functional
- All operations batch until "Push Changes" clicked
- Visual feedback throughout
- No auto-saves - full user control
- Page only refreshes when explicitly pushed

## Testing Notes

1. Create multiple posts, save multiple times - should only push latest
2. Delete a post then recreate with same title - should handle gracefully
3. Refresh page with pending operations - should restore queue with warning
4. Check beforeunload warning (lines 4085-4093)

## Potential Issues to Watch

1. **Temp IDs**: New posts use 'new-post-123456' until saved, then get real filename
2. **Password hashing**: Happens in executeSave now, not in queueBlogSave
3. **Category sanitization**: Still happens but silently in background

## Next Steps (Not Requested)

User seems happy with implementation. Possible future enhancements:
- Undo/redo for operations
- Diff view showing what will be pushed
- Conflict resolution if files changed on disk

## Key Files Modified

```
src/pages/notepad.astro (main implementation)
CLAUDE.md (added pitfall #19)
docs/notepad-critical-knowledge.md (comprehensive queue docs)
```

## How to Continue Work

1. Run `npm run dev` (port 4322)
2. Navigate to `/notepad`
3. Create/edit/delete some blog posts
4. Watch the "Push Changes (n)" button update
5. Click to push and observe smooth reload

The queue persists across refreshes, so you can test crash recovery by refreshing with pending operations.
