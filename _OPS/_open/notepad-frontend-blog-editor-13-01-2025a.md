# Notepad Frontend Blog Editor - Session Handover Brief

## Session Overview
The user requested to make their Astro blog site editable directly from the frontend. We extended the existing notepad feature (`/notepad`) to become a full blog post editor with the following capabilities:

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Blog Post Browser in Notepad
- Added "Blog Posts/" section in the notepad sidebar below "Notes/"
- Lists all existing blog posts from `src/content/blog/`
- Shows category, title, and date for each post
- Click any post to load it for editing

### 2. Blog Post Editing
- Loads full markdown content into the editor
- Added frontmatter editor UI with fields for:
  - Title (in main header)
  - Description
  - Date picker
  - Page type dropdown (all types)
  - Category
  - Private checkbox + password
  - Visual markers (!, ?) with count and color

### 3. Create New Blog Posts
- Added "[new blog post]" button
- Clears editor and sets defaults
- Same frontmatter fields available

### 4. Multiple Save Options
- **[export post]** - Downloads .md file
- **[save to folder]** - Uses File System API (Chrome only)
- **[save to blog]** - Saves directly via API (dev mode)

### 5. Dev Server Integration
- Created `blog-save-server.js` - Express server on port 4322
- Modified `run-dev.sh` to start save server automatically
- API endpoint: `POST http://localhost:4322/api/save-blog-post`
- Saves files directly to `src/content/blog/`

## Current Issue: Blog Posts Not Displaying Properly

### Problem
- Blog posts ARE loading (33 posts found)
- Functionality works (clicking opens posts)
- But display is broken - shows as plain text, not styled

### Root Cause
The blog posts data is being passed correctly:
```javascript
window.BLOG_POSTS = posts; // This works, has 33 posts
```

But the CSS styling isn't applying. The HTML structure is created but appears as:
```
"[articles]cogsecJul 13, 2025
[arts]music thoughtsJul 13, 2025"
```

Instead of properly styled list items.

## Files Modified

### Main Files
1. **`src/pages/notepad.astro`** - All editor functionality
2. **`blog-save-server.js`** - Express server for saving
3. **`run-dev.sh`** - Modified to start save server
4. **`package.json`** - Added express dependency

### Key Code Sections
- Lines 1289-1355: `populateBlogPosts()` function
- Lines 1358-1382: `loadBlogPost()` function  
- Lines 2851-2901: `createNewBlogPost()` function
- Lines 2872-2969: `saveBlogPostToAPI()` function
- Lines 210-264: Blog post list CSS

## Next Steps to Fix Display Issue

### Option 1: Debug CSS Application
1. Check browser DevTools - are the CSS classes being applied?
2. Look for CSS conflicts with existing styles
3. Verify the HTML structure matches what CSS expects

### Option 2: Simplify Structure
Instead of complex spans/divs, try:
```javascript
const li = document.createElement('li');
li.className = 'blog-post-item';
li.innerHTML = `
  <div class="post-title">${post.title}</div>
  <div class="post-meta">
    <span class="post-category">[${post.category}]</span>
    <span class="post-date">${dateStr}</span>
  </div>
`;
```

### Option 3: Match Note List Structure
Copy the exact structure/styling from the working notes list above it.

## How to Test
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/notepad`
3. Check console for:
   - "Setting up BLOG_POSTS..."
   - "BLOG_POSTS set with 33 posts"
   - "Loading blog posts: 33"
4. Blog posts should appear in sidebar
5. Click to edit, make changes, click "[save to blog]"

## Important Context
- Site uses `output: 'static'` - no server-side in production
- All data persistence is client-side (localStorage/IndexedDB)
- The notepad was already a sophisticated editor with image support
- We're extending it rather than building from scratch
- File System API only works in Chromium browsers
- The dev server solution only works during `npm run dev`

## User's Ultimate Goal
"I just want to make changes to the site via the site" - they want to edit blog posts directly in the browser and save them back to the project without manual file handling. Planning to self-host later.

## What Works
- ✅ Loading blog posts data
- ✅ Click functionality 
- ✅ Editing posts
- ✅ Saving posts (all 3 methods)
- ✅ Creating new posts
- ❌ Visual styling of blog post list

The functionality is complete, just needs the display issue fixed!

## Critical Implementation Details

### Password Hashing
- Uses SHA-256 in browser: `crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', msgBuffer)`
- Stored in frontmatter as `passwordHash`
- Note: This is client-side hashing, not secure for production

### Frontmatter Generation
```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
description: "Description here"
pubDate: 2025-01-13T00:00:00.000Z
pageType: "blog"
category: "uncategorized"
private: false
markType: "exclamation"
markCount: 2
markColor: "red"
---
```

### File Naming
- Uses `generateSlug()` function to create URL-safe filenames
- Example: "My Blog Post!" → "my-blog-post.md"

### Data Flow
1. Astro fetches posts at build time via `getCollection('blog')`
2. Posts passed to client via `<script define:vars={{ posts }}>`
3. Stored in `window.BLOG_POSTS` array
4. Each post has: id, title, pubDate, category, description, content, pageType, etc.

## Documentation Updates Needed

### 1. Update `CLAUDE.md`
Add section about notepad blog editing:
```markdown
## Notepad Blog Editor
- Create/edit blog posts at `/notepad`
- Click "[new blog post]" or select existing post
- Fill metadata fields (title, description, category, etc.)
- Click "[save to blog]" during dev to save directly
- Requires `npm run dev` for save functionality
```

### 2. Update `docs/notepad-critical-knowledge.md`
Add new section:
```markdown
## Blog Post Editing Integration (2025-01-13)

### Architecture
- Blog posts loaded via `getCollection('blog')` at build time
- Passed to client via `define:vars` in script tag
- Stored in `window.BLOG_POSTS` global

### Save Methods
1. **Export** - Downloads .md file
2. **Save to Folder** - File System API (Chrome only)
3. **Save to Blog** - Dev server API on port 4322

### Known Issues
- Blog post list CSS not applying properly
- Shows as plain text instead of styled items
```

### 3. Create New Doc: `docs/blog-frontend-editing.md`
Full documentation of the feature including:
- How to use it
- Technical implementation
- API endpoints
- Troubleshooting

### 4. Update `docs/features_index.md`
Add entry:
```markdown
### Blog Frontend Editing
**Location**: `src/pages/notepad.astro` (lines 1289-2969)
**Purpose**: Edit blog posts directly in the browser
**Status**: Implemented, CSS styling issue pending
```

## Missing Context for Docs

### API Endpoint Details
```javascript
POST http://localhost:4322/api/save-blog-post
Body: {
  filename: "post-slug.md",
  content: "---\nfrontmatter\n---\n\nContent here"
}
Response: {
  success: true,
  filename: "post-slug.md",
  message: "Blog post saved as post-slug.md"
}
```

### Dependencies Added
- `express: ^4.18.2` (devDependency)

### Environment Requirements
- Node.js >= 18.17.1
- Chrome/Edge for File System API
- Port 4322 available for save server

## Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check if save server is running
lsof -i :4322

# Test API directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:4322/api/save-blog-post \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"filename":"test.md","content":"# Test"}'

# Check browser console
window.BLOG_POSTS // Should show array of posts
```
