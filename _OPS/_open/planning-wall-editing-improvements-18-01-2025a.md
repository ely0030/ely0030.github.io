# Planning Wall Editing Improvements - Session Handoff
**Date**: 18-01-2025  
**Session ID**: planning-wall-editing-improvements-18-01-2025a  
**Status**: COMPLETE - All requested features implemented and working

## Summary
User requested multiple UX improvements to the planning wall's card editing experience. Started with cursor behavior issues and evolved into a complete rewrite of the description field editing using contenteditable. All changes successfully implemented and documented.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Fixed Edit Mode Cursor Behavior
**Issue**: Double-click required - first click entered edit mode, second to position cursor  
**Solution**: Removed for description field - now uses contenteditable for instant editing

### 2. Dropdown UX Improvements
**Issues Fixed**:
- Priority dropdown wouldn't close properly
- Dropdowns required two clicks to use
- Text was selectable in dropdown options

**Solutions**:
- Added toggle behavior - clicking field again closes dropdown (lines 770-774)
- Replaced native `<select>` with custom dropdowns that work on first click
- Added `user-select: none` to dropdown options (line 232)
- Fixed click-away bug by storing `activeDropdownField` reference (line 868)

### 3. Description Field Complete Rewrite
**Old**: Click → textarea replacement → loss of context  
**New**: ContentEditable div with instant cursor positioning

Key implementation details:
- `setupContentEditable()` at lines 704-786
- Click anywhere → cursor appears at exact position via `caretRangeFromPoint()`
- Enter key properly handled with `<br>` + zero-width space trick
- Text extraction via TreeWalker preserves all formatting

### 4. Newline Preservation
**Issue**: `.trim()` was destroying newlines in descriptions  
**Fix**: Only trim title fields (line 826), preserve all whitespace in descriptions

### 5. Ghost Cards Enhancement
**Old**: Temporary card UI that couldn't be moved  
**New**: Real cards with `isGhost: true` flag - fully functional but styled gray until named

### 6. Visual Polish
- Moved unsaved indicators from individual cards to control bar: `[save • 3]`
- Made "Index" text clickable, turns blue on hover, navigates home
- Removed focus outlines on buttons with proper CSS specificity

## Critical Implementation Details

### ContentEditable Gotchas
1. **Enter Key Handling** (lines 762-785)
   ```javascript
   // Must insert BR + zero-width space for cursor positioning
   const br = document.createElement('br');
   const textNode = document.createTextNode('\u200B');
   ```

2. **Text Extraction** (lines 729-752)
   - Uses TreeWalker to properly convert BR → \n
   - MUST strip zero-width spaces: `text.replace(/\u200B/g, '')`

3. **Save Trigger**
   - Saves on blur automatically
   - No mode switching - looks identical when editing or not

### Custom Dropdown Implementation
- Positioned absolutely using `getBoundingClientRect()`
- Appended to body to avoid clipping
- Event delegation for option clicks
- Cleanup on removal to prevent memory leaks

## File Modified
`/src/pages/planning-wall.astro` - All changes inline, no external dependencies

## If User Reports Issues

### "Can't make newlines in description"
- Check if Enter key handler is working (lines 761-785)
- Verify zero-width spaces are being inserted
- Check console for errors in range manipulation

### "Dropdown closes immediately"
- Verify `activeDropdownField` is being set (line 868)
- Check click event isn't bubbling from field

### "Description lost formatting"
- Check line 826 - should NOT trim description fields
- Verify TreeWalker is extracting BR tags correctly

### "Cards jump when editing"
- This shouldn't happen with contenteditable
- If seeing textarea, wrong code path is executing

## Next Possible Enhancements
1. Rich text formatting (bold, italic) for descriptions
2. Markdown rendering in view mode
3. Auto-save with debouncing
4. Undo/redo for edits

## Documentation Updated
1. `/docs/planning-wall.md` - Added "Card Editing" section with all discoveries
2. `/docs/css-spacing-pitfalls.md` - Added contenteditable and dropdown sections  
3. `/CLAUDE.md` - Added pitfall #20 for contenteditable gotchas

## Key Insight
ContentEditable is tricky but worth it for seamless editing UX. The zero-width space trick is CRITICAL - without it, cursor positioning breaks after Enter key. This pattern could be reused in the notepad editor for similar improvements.
