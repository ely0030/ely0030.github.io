# Notepad Frontend Blog Editor - Session Handover Brief (Part C)

## Session Context
This session focused on solving the Astro dev server reload problem and fixing edit mode bugs in the notepad blog editor. The blog editor allows creating/editing blog posts directly from `/notepad` during development.

## Major Achievement: Save Queue System ✅

### The Problem We Solved
- Astro HMR watches `src/content/blog/` → ANY file change = instant page reload
- Every blog save disrupted the editing experience with a jarring reload
- Previous attempts (session b) tried to restore state after reload, but still had interruption

### The Solution: Defer Disk Writes
Instead of writing to disk immediately, we implemented a **save queue**:
1. `[queue save]` button → saves to memory only (NO reload!)
2. `[push changes to disk]` button → manual write (will reload)
3. Auto-push on navigation → writes queued changes when switching posts/notes

### Key Implementation Files
- `src/pages/notepad.astro` - All frontend logic
- `blog-save-server.js` - Backend API on port 4322

### Critical Code Locations
```
pendingBlogSave property (:1297) - Stores queued save data
queueBlogSave() (:3112-3162) - Captures state without disk write
executePendingSave() (:3165-3310) - Actual disk write
Auto-triggers:
  - loadNote(:1705)
  - loadBlogPost(:1501) 
  - createNewBlogPost(:3605)
```

### State Restoration (for manual push)
When user clicks `[push changes]`:
1. Store state in sessionStorage (:3682-3688)
2. Execute save → Astro reloads
3. Init checks for pendingReload (:1342-1380)
4. Restores exact post + scroll positions

### GOTCHA: New Post ID Mapping
- New posts use temp IDs like `new-post-1234567890`
- After save, real ID comes from `result.filename`
- MUST update sessionStorage with real ID (:3279-3289)
- Otherwise restoration fails after reload

## Edit Mode Newline Bug Fix ✅

### The Problem
When toggling to edit mode, newlines were getting squashed. Users had to re-enter line breaks.

### Root Cause
`editor.textContent = plainText` doesn't preserve newlines in contentEditable elements.

### The Fix (:2709-2717)
```javascript
const lines = plainText.split('\n');
editor.innerHTML = lines.map(line => {
  if (line === '') return '<div class="empty-line">&nbsp;</div>';
  return `<div class="text-line">${this.escapeHtml(line)}</div>`;
}).join('');
```

## Current State
- ✅ Save queue prevents reloads during editing
- ✅ Push button gives user control over when to save
- ✅ State restoration works for both new and existing posts
- ✅ Edit mode preserves newlines correctly
- ✅ All delays removed - everything is instant

## Next Steps & Improvements

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Visual save indicator** - Show a dot/badge when there are queued changes
2. **Keyboard shortcut** - Add Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S for push to disk
3. **Auto-save timer** - Optionally push changes every X minutes
4. **Conflict detection** - Warn if file changed on disk while editing

### Longer Term
1. **Multi-file queue** - Queue saves across multiple blog posts
2. **Diff view** - Show what changed before pushing
3. **Undo queue** - Restore previous versions from memory
4. **Smart push** - Only reload if OTHER files changed during save

## Testing Instructions
```bash
npm run dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:4321/notepad
# Click [new blog post] or select existing
# Edit content
# Click [queue save] - no reload!
# Click [push changes to disk] - reloads but restores state
```

## Known Issues
- beforeunload warning can't force save (browser limitation)
- Queue is lost if browser crashes (consider localStorage backup)

## Key Files Modified This Session
1. `src/pages/notepad.astro` - Save queue + newline fix
2. `CLAUDE.md` - Added pitfalls #16-17
3. `docs/notepad-critical-knowledge.md` - Detailed implementation
4. `docs/blog-frontend-editing.md` - Architecture overview

The save queue system is a game-changer for the editing experience. Users can now work uninterrupted and choose when to accept the reload cost.
