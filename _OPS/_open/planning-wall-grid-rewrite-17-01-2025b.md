# Planning Wall Grid Rewrite - Session Handoff
**Date**: 17-01-2025  
**Session ID**: planning-wall-grid-rewrite-17-01-2025b  
**Status**: COMPLETE - Feature working, docs updated

## Summary
User had a broken drag-and-drop planning wall (from session 17-01-2025a). We completely rewrote it from a complex column-based system to a simple fixed grid. The rewrite is complete and working well.

## What Was Done

### 1. Complete Architecture Change
**FROM**: Dynamic columns with complex array manipulation
```javascript
this.columns = [[cardId1, cardId2], [cardId3]] // Column arrays
```

**TO**: Fixed 5-column grid with direct positioning
```javascript
this.projects = [{id, title, gridX: 2, gridY: 1, ...}] // Grid coordinates
```

### 2. Simplified Drag-Drop
**OLD**: 200+ lines of placeholder juggling, invisible drop zones, complex calculations  
**NEW**: ~50 lines - just CSS classes on hover, update coordinates on drop

### 3. Key Features Implemented
- Fixed 5-column grid that auto-expands vertically
- Drag any card to any empty slot
- Drag onto occupied slot = cards swap positions
- Visual feedback: dotted borders, opacity changes
- Apache minimalist aesthetic

### 4. Migration Handling
Old projects without gridX/gridY are auto-positioned:
```javascript
project.gridX = index % this.gridColumns;
project.gridY = Math.floor(index / this.gridColumns);
```

## Current State

### Visual Feedback (Final Version)
- **Dragging**: Card at 60% opacity, 2Â° tilt, subtle shadow
- **Empty slot hover**: Single gray dotted border
- **Occupied slot hover**: Target card gets dashed border + gray bg + 70% opacity
- **No animations** - instant, snappy response

### What's Working
- All drag-drop functionality
- Card swapping
- Creating new cards (finds first empty slot)
- Shift+click creates near selected card
- Save/load persistence
- Clean Apache aesthetic

### Files Modified
1. `/src/pages/planning-wall.astro` - Complete rewrite of drag-drop system
2. `/docs/planning-wall.md` - Updated documentation
3. Created backup: `planning-wall.astro.backup-20250117-170602`

## If User Reports Issues

### "Drag-drop not working"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `e.preventDefault()` in dragover handlers
- Ensure data-x/data-y attributes match grid positions

### "Cards disappearing"
- Check localStorage for corrupt gridX/gridY values
- Clear localStorage and refresh

### "Want to change grid size"
- Change `this.gridColumns = 5` (line ~347)
- Update CSS: `grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 300px)`

## Design Decisions

### Why Fixed Grid?
User explicitly requested:
- "Permanent zones"
- "Preconceived grid"
- "Just a bunch of card slots"
- "No swapping around" (meaning no auto-repositioning)

### Why This Visual Feedback?
- Started with crazy neon colors/animations
- User: "tone it down, Apache aesthetic"
- Ended with subtle dotted borders + opacity

### Why Card Swapping?
- User realized dropping on occupied slots needed handling
- Simple swap was clearest solution

## Next Possible Enhancements
1. Configurable grid size (currently hardcoded 5 columns)
2. Keyboard navigation between cards
3. Bulk operations (select multiple cards)
4. Export/import project data

## Session End State
- Feature complete and working
- User happy with result ("Oh this is clean hell yeah Claude")
- Documentation updated
- No outstanding bugs

**Note to next instance**: The old column-based system is completely gone. Don't reference old docs or try to merge approaches. The grid system is simpler and works perfectly.
