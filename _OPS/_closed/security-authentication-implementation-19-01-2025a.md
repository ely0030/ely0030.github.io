# Security Authentication Implementation - Session Handoff

**Date**: 2025-01-19  
**Session**: Adding authentication to protect blog from IoT devices  
**Status**: COMPLETED - Ready for Mini PC implementation

## Context & Problem

User has a Xiaomi air filter and other IoT devices on their network. Concerned these could be compromised and edit their blog since the original `blog-save-server.js` had NO authentication - anyone on the network could POST to `/api/save-blog-post` and modify content.

## What Was Done This Session

### 1. Created Secure Server (`blog-save-server-secure.js`)
- **Location**: Root directory
- **Key features**:
  - Password authentication via Bearer tokens
  - Rate limiting: 5 login attempts per 15 minutes (prevents brute force)
  - Path traversal protection (can't escape blog directory with `../`)
  - Environment-based config: `BLOG_AUTH_PASSWORD` in `.env`
- **Critical lines**:
  - Lines 20-27: Password setup and token generation
  - Lines 30-47: Rate limiting implementation
  - Lines 50-63: Authentication middleware
  - Lines 94-101: Path validation

### 2. Created Client Auth (`notepad-auth-patch.js`)
- **Location**: Root directory
- **Purpose**: Adds login UI to notepad
- **Features**:
  - Login modal with password field
  - Token storage in localStorage
  - Auto-adds auth headers to API calls
  - Logout functionality
- **Integration**: Copy entire file contents into notepad.astro after `<script>` tag

### 3. Created Security Blueprints
- **Location**: `_OPS/BLUEPRINTS/security-enhancement/`
- **Contents**: 6 detailed future security enhancement plans
  - Master plan + 6 individual blueprints
  - Covers auth, encryption, access control, etc.
- **Note**: These are FUTURE plans, not implemented yet

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated 6 docs with security info
- Created `SECURITY-SETUP.md` (comprehensive guide)
- Created `MINIPC-AUTH-STEPS.md` (quick setup for Mini PC)

## Current State

### What's Protected
- ✅ Blog save/delete endpoints require password
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents password guessing
- ✅ Path traversal attacks blocked
- ✅ IoT devices can't edit without password

### What's NOT Protected
- ❌ Reading posts (still public)
- ❌ No encryption at rest
- ❌ No user roles (single password for all)
- ❌ Client-side password protection still weak

## Next Steps for Mini PC

1. **Pull latest code**
2. **Create `.env` file** with strong password
3. **Update scripts** to use `blog-save-server-secure.js`
4. **Test auth** works in notepad

See `MINIPC-AUTH-STEPS.md` for exact commands.

## Testing Auth Works

1. Start servers
2. Go to `/notepad`
3. Try to save a post
4. Should see login modal
5. Enter password from `.env`
6. Save should work

## Common Issues

### "Too many login attempts"
- Wait 15 min or restart server
- Check `.env` has correct password

### No login prompt
- Check using secure server not original
- Check notepad has auth patch
- Check browser console for errors

### Can't save after login
- Token might be expired
- Check Authorization header sent
- Try logout/login again

## Files Modified/Created This Session

**Created**:
- `/blog-save-server-secure.js` - Main secure server
- `/notepad-auth-patch.js` - Client auth code
- `/SECURITY-SETUP.md` - Full setup guide
- `/MINIPC-AUTH-STEPS.md` - Quick Mini PC guide
- `/_OPS/BLUEPRINTS/security-enhancement/*` - 7 blueprint files

**Modified**:
- `/docs/development_workflow.md` - Added security section
- `/docs/network-hosting-setup.md` - Added auth info
- `/docs/troubleshooting.md` - Added auth issues
- `/docs/changelog.md` - Added today's entry
- `/docs/DOCS.MAP.MD` - Added security files
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Added security quick ref

**Deleted** (cleanup):
- 10 test files from root (6 .md, 4 images)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Simple password auth** over complex JWT system - easier to implement
2. **Rate limiting** essential to prevent brute force from IoT devices
3. **Path validation** critical - IoT malware often tries directory escaping
4. **Keep it simple** - user just wants protection from air filter, not NSA

## Important Context Lost

- User specifically worried about Xiaomi air filter being compromised
- They trust their WiFi network generally, just not IoT devices
- Quick security more important than perfect security
- Mini PC is the production server that needs updating

## Git Status

All changes committed and pushed. Ready for Mini PC to pull and implement.
