        <h1>Worldview Summary</h1>
        
        <p>This is a curated stable document that represents a key aspect of my thinking. Unlike essays which represent thoughts in progress, this exhibit contains more permanent, synthesized ideas.</p>
        
        <p>Key principles of my worldview include:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Principle 1 <span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote">This is a sidenote that provides additional context for this principle.</span></li>
            <li>Principle 2</li>
            <li>Principle 3</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These interconnected ideas form the foundation of how I navigate and interpret the world around me.</p>
