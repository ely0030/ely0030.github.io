# Apache-Style Notepad Update

## What Changed

### Visual Style Updates
1. **Apache Index Header**: Added "Index of /notepad" with horizontal rule
2. **Monospace Font**: Everything uses monospace to match the site
3. **Minimalist Buttons**: Changed buttons to `[action]` style links
4. **Black Borders**: Simple 1px solid black borders instead of rounded/colored
5. **Lowercase Text**: All UI text is lowercase (untitled, new note, etc.)

### Layout Changes
- Removed colored backgrounds and rounded corners
- Simple vertical line separator between notes list and editor
- Dotted border when editing (classic textarea style)
- Headers render as same size bold text (no size changes)
- Subtle gray hover states

### Interaction Updates
- Links instead of buttons with underline on idle, no underline on hover
- Delete shows as `[x]` instead of `Ã—`
- Orange accent only for primary actions and untitled note
- More compact spacing throughout

## Result
The notepad now perfectly matches the minimalist Apache index aesthetic of your site while maintaining all the Obsidian-style editing functionality. It feels like a natural extension of the site rather than a separate modern app.
