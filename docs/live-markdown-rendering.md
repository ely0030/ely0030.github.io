# Live Markdown Rendering Implementation

## What's New

The notepad now renders markdown as you type, just like Obsidian!

### How it works:
1. **Type markdown syntax** - e.g., `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `# heading`
2. **See it render immediately** - the text becomes bold/italic/etc while showing the syntax
3. **Syntax stays visible but dimmed** - the `**` marks are gray while the text is bold
4. **Cursor position preserved** - keeps typing smoothly without jumps

### Supported Markdown:
- **Bold**: `**text**` → **text** (with gray **)
- *Italic*: `*text*` → *text* (with gray *)
- Headers: `# text`, `## text`, `### text` → bold text (with gray #)
- Links: `[text](url)` → clickable link (gray brackets, hidden URL)
- Code: `` `code` `` → highlighted code (with gray backticks)

### Hyperlink Behavior:
- **Default**: `[text](url)` shows as `[text]` - URL hidden
- **Click link text**: URL expands and stays visible for editing
- **Click brackets `[]`**: Toggles URL visibility
- **Click outside editor**: All URLs auto-hide
- **Critical**: Links are clickable but don't navigate in editor

### Technical Details:
- Always in edit mode (contentEditable)
- Formatting on blur only (prevents cursor jumps)
- TreeWalker extracts all text including hidden URLs
- `contenteditable="false"` on links makes them clickable
- Tab/Shift+Tab for indent/un-indent (2 spaces)
- Each line wrapped in `<div>` to preserve empty lines
- Focus forced on click to enable blur events

### Apache Style Maintained:
- Headers stay same size (just bold)
- Monospace font throughout
- Minimal styling
- Gray syntax markers (#999 color)

## Result
The editor now provides a true Obsidian-like experience where markdown renders as you type, making writing more visual while keeping the markdown syntax visible for editing.
