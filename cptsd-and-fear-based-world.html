        <h1>cPTSD and the Fear-Based World</h1>

        <p>I'm beginning to notice that everything I do has associations with some type of negative emotion.</p>

        <p class="triple-space-after">My entire world is permeated by fear and anxiety.</p>

        <p>I think cPTSD is the maladaptation to having every simple mundane task, become associated with a fear memory.</p>

        <p>Just now for example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Typing behind the computer while I should be asleep is triggering guilt and shame</li>
            <li>Opening the door to go the the bathroom is triggering anxiety (in case my parents hear (and the implications of this are shame/etc.))</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Even down to writing a note like this,<br>
        the fear of getting it wrong,<br>
        the fear of wasting my time,<br>
        the fear of it being time spent better elsewhere,</p>

        <p>every little thing I do carries an undercurrent of fear and anxiety.</p>

        <p class="double-space-after">I take this for granted,<br>
        to me, this is normal</p>

        <p class="triple-space-after">I'm beginning to think it's not though.</p>

        <h2>ADHD and cPTSD (ADHD-c)</h2>

        <p>If everything carries a negative connotation, then it'd make sense that every action would be heavily disincentivized as well. The learned helplessness you see in people with cPTSD,<br>
        why wouldn't they have it?</p>

        <p class="triple-space-after">There is no reward in anything,<br>
        and there is only punishment in everything.</p>

        <p>This carries over to even the thoughts of these actions, or certain thoughts in general.</p>

        <p>If every subject/thought arouses intense negative emotion, wouldn't it make sense not to focus on any of them?</p>

        <p>Is it ADHD if you're subconsciously blocking the subject you're darting away from out?</p>

        <p>Maybe this is what causes the classic glassiness often found in traumatized people. The shell shocked eyes. The absentmindedness of the crazy belligerent lady on the corner.</p>

        <p>I've talked to them before, and there's this distinct feeling of some part of their mind not being fully there.</p>

        <p>And it's probably true. The live in delusion, because most of their real thoughts and memories carry a valence of intense negative emotion.</p>

        <p>I'm noticing this a lot with cPTSD victims: bring up anything remotely related to some uncomfortable truth, and they will almost be literally incapable of engaging with the subject matter.<aside>This is a footnote reference.<a href="#note1" id="ref1">1</a></aside></p>

        <p class="double-space-after">Now imagine if these negative connotations spread down towards even the tiniest mundane little thing.</p>

        <p>What would the world look like to a person with cPTSD?</p>

                <li id="note1">Additionally the lengths sufferers of cPTSD go to avoid talking or even thinking about their trauma is pretty astounding. A maze of comfortable delusions that just keeps getting built on further and further. Though resembling the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OddPlanet/comments/1bmykjz/the_winchester_mystery_house_in_california_is/">Winchester house</a> to an outside observer, trying to argue against these seemingly nonsensical beliefs is a well-intentioned but <a href="https://x.com/visakanv/status/1505864899016073216">ultimately ineffective approach</a>. <a href="#ref1">↩</a></li>
