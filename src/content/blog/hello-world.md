Welcome to my new blog! I built this space using Astro, a modern tool focused on speed and efficiency<label for="sn-astro" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-astro" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.</span>. Here, I'm excited to share my journey learning Astro and CSS, along with web development tips, insights into my personal projects, and thoughts on the ever-evolving world of technology.

## What to Expect

In the coming weeks and months, I'll be diving deep into various topics including:
