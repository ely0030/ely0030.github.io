# The coochie has been commoditized

Back in the day there used to be this myth-like feeling around everything

the internet was basically a series of doors with locks, or puzzles with rewards

so you'd go on the internet, and somewhere somehow, there was an entire game downloadable for free on a random torrent site

but you risked bricking your pc
you risked, well, not even finding the link at all

there was a kind of secrecy to it, or a kind of excitement

things were pretty cool



I remember my first time finding porn, and it was like this blocked off district of the internet
this like dark place where you got access to like this hidden and valuable impossible resource

you'd walk around in real life, and maybe see pretty girls, some time, and mostly you'd just be watching TV, watching movies, and the world was this tame blocked off place where the rules of nature still applied

you were NOT gonna see that beautiful women strip for you any time soon.


So, when you got the internet and you just kinda stumbled upon this latent goldmine, the feeling and the myth surrounding it was crazy

--
The reason I'm thinking about this is because I'm on a torrent site that has an "XXX" section. I've never used it, but seeing it does remind me of a time where porn was valuable and rare. The coochie was guarded.

Now it's just out all the time.


And I think that's a shame.

The exact kind of feeling I get when I discover new music nowadays, or listen to music anywhere.

It feels like a very boring systematic machine. It's like the world's become andy warhol's pop art, and it's not tongue-in-cheek or anything special at all besides the efficiency and the output of the manufacturing process.

Hell, music and art always was a kind of machine-like process to some extent, but at least it was gate kept from you in a certain way that made accessing it feel special.

You'd have these big rollouts where all you could do is wait, maybe look for clues, and when that album finally did come out eventually the only time you could let it graze your ears was when you were connected to internet, and sitting on a computer, visiting that specific sketchy web site that offered you the opportunity to play the album or a song off it.

That's become so antiquated and obsolete now I half can't even imagine spotify was a paid thing I couldn't afford.

You literally had to search the internet for a virus free link so that you could download it, or you had to keep pressing reply on the youtube page you had to keep open for the song to keep playing.

It was a good time in hindsight, but back in the day, god was it annoying.

Even when you found a link or a place for it, you'd run into the issue that you could only play that song at places you had internet, and back in the day wireless data plans were fucking expensive (to me anyway), so most of your commute you were out of luck, or any place away from home really.

So, you'd download the album, or the song, 
and then you'd just listen to that.

And it felt like you had it, collected it, found it and managed to capture some kind fairy and put it in a bottle so that you could hear it sing to you whenever you wanted.

There was something so magical about the effort involved and all the obstacles.


These days that entire process is, well, 


you just press a button and you hear the song.

So, I guess the porn just got me a little glimpse of that.

TMI but I feel porn is kind of boring these days. I kind of liked when there was a kind of mystique around it, but now you can just see the best coochie any of your ancestor have ever seen in all of their lives combined before you even hit puberty.

Part of me likes this ofc. I think Onlyfans is awesome in that regard. 

I think you are gay if you cannot appreciate the fact girls that are 0.001% percentile in beautifulness and hotness are bearing their coochie to you on demand (and for free if you just find one of those onlyfans leak sites), and that's just crazy.

But it also makes it all a little boring.

I have seen the queen's coochie, and now I have reached the realization of the value of what coochie truly is.

I have ascended the peak of heaven and I have seen what life has to offer

The question has been quenched, and the curiosity satisfied.



Okay no but being serious again,
yeah, 
that's basically what it comes down to.

People are scrappy and ingenious (ingenuity) though,
so they've switched to the argument that you're just seeing it and not like rawdogging it irl.

okay.

Honestly my argument against that is that I don't really care.

I can go ahead and spend a lot of brainpower arguing this but, I just don't care.



What I do care about is how scarcity engineers the myth, and how the myth gives that spark to life.

I feel that most of what makes life great, and most of what people call the most worthwhile human experience(s), is mostly made up out of illusion.

If movies and plays are a bunch of actors and visuals trying to convince you that you're looking at interesting stuff happening, then basically all the things that humans care about the most is exactly like that.

When a mosquito dies, we see bunch of matter get zapped

but when a family member dies it is one of the worst days of your life


i will not argue that any further.



But yeah, I think to enjoy life is to enjoy the show, and I think mostly to watch good TV while you're at it.

I digressed.

So why the porn bit? Because it's the best example of something everybody feels a way towards (even if you're not into art or human experience) that suddenly became ubiquitously available and made cheap.

And it saddens me that things have become so abundant in a certain way, even though it really shouldn't.


There's gold rush going on, but instead I'm swimming in the champagne feeling sad, and annoyed at the amount of bubble against my skin.


Music used to be like this.
Finding an artist, a special song, or even a full album, was like finding a piece of gold in the river.

It's not the fact that it's rare specifically, but I think the entire experience around it just added more dimension to it.

It's like they took a hike, but they just fixed it so that you got teleported to the destination instantly

yeah it's nice and i can get to be where I want, but in that search for optimization it obviously trimmed a lot of the nutrients present in what we thought was just meaningless fat

or maybe we knew, but yes money money money money money, yes, we know, capitalism is bad.

such is Moloch I suppose.


Simone Weil moment? 
Maybe.
I havent read her.

But yeah I also just kinda miss the whole, well, I guess it's just a certain feeling.

I'm clicking on this one XXX torrent video of like a couple gigs, and I won't download it, so I just click on this image collage of the vid, where it's like 12 frames or smth of what happens in the video, and it's like damn,

damn, back in the day i'd take this shit and be ecstatic.

There were days where I didn't have internet access and i'd just look at the girl fashion magazines. Playboys were crazy back then. 

I never had one, but sometimes some guys would find a magazine somewhere, and you'd just look at the shit in awe. 

The magic of being human.

Or, another fun one, 
I remember not having internet access, but maybe I did have PC access, and the you'd just have to settle for looking at one frame or one fucking image, and you'd see the 12 image collage for example, and that'd be the fucking gold mine then.

Now it's never enough.

I could see the most beautiful I've ever seen in my life jump on it silly style and it would still not be enough to feel special.



-
and also honestly thinking of it, it was also just the entire interface of checking finding it. 

I suppose the internet was kind of this point and click game that offered everything, so a big part of the fun and the experience was to crawl the web like that, and to then get something like that popping out at you.

Nothing beats that honestly, and I think it was actually pretty wild and interesting situation in hindsight.

You'd just log onto the everything machine, and you literally did have the world at your fingertips.

I haven't had that feeling in years. It's now all so sanitized. Always feels like going to a mcdonalds for retards now.

It's like the built a massive ramp to the special section, and its the mega corpo social media sites.

The internet is (allegedly), still out there, to I doubt it. It's sucking up the bandwidth and the talent.

They're poaching the schizos in return for big dopamine and validation payouts.

Though, maybe I'm just not in the right places anymore.
