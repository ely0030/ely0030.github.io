# phallic-apologism
There's this thing where artists keep putting dicks in their art (drawing dicks), and then this gallery of art curators spitting out bullshit like "it's a metaphor for creative energy" or "when she touched the phallic shaped stone it activated. This is a metaphor for the life force impetus activating as an allegory to the creation of life"

no man

this is just a monkey drawing boobies and pp's man

i said it crudely, but it's actually true

why does a guy like looking at boobies?

you can come up with a million sophisticated reasons and fully baked out philosophical theories and ideals for what it could represent in "the grander scheme of things" or whatever

but no, it's just a monkey programmed to have SEX. Okay?


and it pisses me off that people can't admit it because it drops the kay-fabe.

Once you accept that horny monkeys can make beautiful art it's still really interesting,
but,

the art needs to be sanitized for the collectors, 
for the audience, 
for the world and its Christian ideals


Do we be honest or do we be on the grind?
