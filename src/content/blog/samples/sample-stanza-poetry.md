# Verses in Motion: The Stanza Experience

**Page Type:** `pageType: "stanza"`

*Watch the progress bar above as you scroll through this poetic journey.*

## The Digital Poem

In pixels bright and spaces wide,  
Where verses flow and meanings hide,  
The stanza layout comes alive—  
A place where poetry can thrive.

Each line receives its proper space,  
Each word can find its perfect place,  
The progress bar above does show  
How far through verses we must go.

## Features of the Stanza Type

The stanza page type brings poetry to life with:

- A **reading progress bar** that tracks your journey through the piece
- Optimized spacing for verse and prose poetry
- Typography that respects line breaks and stanza structure
- A meditative reading pace that honors the form

### When Words Need Room to Breathe

Poetry demands different treatment  
From prose that fills the page complete.  
Each line break holds its own meaning,  
Each pause, a heartbeat in between.

The stanza type understands this need—  
It gives your verses room to breathe,  
To stand alone or flow together,  
Light as air or dense as weather.

## Mixed Forms Welcome

Not just for traditional verse, the stanza layout works beautifully for:

**Prose Poetry**

The morning arrives not with fanfare but with whispers, sliding beneath doorways and between curtain gaps, carrying the smell of rain that hasn't fallen yet, promises that haven't been made, dreams that linger just beyond waking.

**Free Verse**

No rules  
    except the ones  
        we make ourselves—  
indentation  
                becomes  
                        meaning,  
            space  
    transforms  
into  
    pause.

**Experimental Forms**

w  o  r  d  s  
           can  
     scatter  
               like  
    leaves  
              in  
         autumn  
                  wind

## The Progress Bar: Your Reading Companion

Notice how the progress bar at the top tracks your journey through this piece. It's a gentle companion, never rushing, simply marking your path through the verses like footsteps in snow.

This feature is particularly powerful for longer poems or prose pieces where readers might appreciate knowing how much remains of their journey.

## A Meditation on Reading

The stanza layout transforms reading  
Into something more than words.  
It becomes a meditation,  
A moment stolen from the world.

Each scroll is deliberate,  
Each pause has weight and meaning.  
The progress bar reminds us:  
This too is worth completing.

## When to Choose Stanza

Reach for this page type when you have:

- **Poetry** of any form or style
- **Lyrical prose** that benefits from careful pacing
- **Contemplative essays** meant to be savored
- **Song lyrics** or spoken word pieces
- **Any content** where the journey matters as much as the destination

## Closing Verse

So here we end our stanza tour,  
The progress bar now nearly full.  
This layout waits for verses more—  
Your poetry, powerful or thoughtful.

May all your words find perfect space,  
May all your lines know their place,  
And may the stanza page type be  
The home your poetry needs to breathe.
