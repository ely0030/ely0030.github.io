# The Standard Blog Experience

**Page Type:** `pageType: "blog"` (or omit for default)

This is a demonstration of the **default blog page type**, which provides clean, readable typography perfect for general blog posts and articles.

## Key Features of the Blog Type

The standard blog layout offers:

- Clean, readable typography with comfortable line spacing
- Responsive design that works beautifully on all devices
- Support for all markdown formatting options
- Visual markers for special posts (notice the gold stars above)

### Typography Examples

Regular paragraphs flow naturally with appropriate spacing. The font size and line height are optimized for extended reading sessions without eye strain.

You can use **bold text** for emphasis, *italics* for subtle highlights, and `inline code` for technical terms. Links like [this example](#) are styled to be clear but not distracting.

> Blockquotes stand out with special formatting, perfect for highlighting important quotes or key takeaways from your content.

### Code Blocks

```javascript
// Code blocks are syntax highlighted
function demonstratePageType() {
  const pageType = 'blog';
  console.log(`Current page type: ${pageType}`);
  return {
    typography: 'standard',
    spacing: 'comfortable',
    readability: 'excellent'
  };
}
```

### Lists and Structure

Unordered lists work beautifully:
- First point with clear bullet
- Second point with consistent spacing
- Third point maintaining rhythm

Ordered lists for sequential content:
1. Step one in your process
2. Step two with detailed explanation
3. Final step to complete the task

## Images in Blog Posts

Images can be positioned and sized using special classes:
