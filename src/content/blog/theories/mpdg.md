there's this thing were you see girls act in like this schelling point global optimum of cute behavior

i see them as like apex predators that just kinda figured out how to do all these things that press the buttons of the opposite sex, and honestly it works

but i don't really see them as human much most times. 
They're very good at this but it's mostly instinctual, there's not really much else going on as this is enough if that makes sense



### Examples:

Great example. Also because this duo is basically known for talking about sex and being a nerdy guy with a hot girl. It's crazy how this archetype got monetized like this, this successfully and unashamedly. Schellingpoint of what the isolated 2025 human likes to watch.

I think Katchii is such a good example of a hot girl who knows she's hot and knows what to do get by on that. Every interaction is her just spamming hot girl behavior moves, and it working incredibly well.

I think the background of her being from the Philippines and basically striking it big in the Twitch scene also adds a lot to this? Sh
- Natalie Portman in closer (and most of her movies tbh)
