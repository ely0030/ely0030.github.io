Texted harvard but they said they already have an idea?



anyway, there's tons of things that i could talk about
the biggest issue is going from the ideation phase to the "clean presentation" phase

honestly i think this should be pretty easy

maybe make an ideation folder, and then a condensed folder to put in the clean distilled version of that file

or maybe a toggle switch

honestly i like that idea  alot

you just open a page in the theories folder and it looks clean and incredibly succinct and concise/high signal

then you can press a button somewhere and it just shows the schizo raw file of all my ideas leading up to that clean idea

i love that idea


you're able to pack a lot of depth into a little bit of concise detail-less text that way

it's all backed up by something real in the vault (money bills gold reference)




yeah, that seems great honestly

1. the distilled version
2. the raw schizo file behind it

perfect idea.

sates both my need for one million caveats and tangents

and the need to be high signal and not waste the time of the reader ((me) mostly))
