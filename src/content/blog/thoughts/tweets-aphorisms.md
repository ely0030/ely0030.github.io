"power corrupts" is cope people tell themselves to feel better about their lack of power, and the fact that they're not willing to chase it themselves.

It's a slave morality thing.

I'll be pretty honest, power "corrupting" seems more like a selection bias thing; people that seek out power are generally not very good people.

you're very unlikely to see a truly good person also possess an insatiable drive to amass power. It just doesn't happen that much.

becoming adept at wielding power requires you to see past simplistic morality. You'll look evil, and in the name of pragmatism and utilitarianism you will not be able to present a "clean moral" face anymore that is completely connotatively blameless and immaculate.

welcome to the real world / sorry

"the mechanism seems less "power reveals true character" and more "power creates adaptive pressures that reward paranoia, control-seeking, and viewing people as abstractions.""

The tibetan word for power, nus pa, is a more fitting one.

It doesn't carry the connotative contamination "power" does.

When discussing power, nus pa is more apt to use instead.
