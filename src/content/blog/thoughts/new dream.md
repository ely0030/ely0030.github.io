I have a new dream of a more evidence based life.
A new symbiosis

---
The dream kind of consists of completely embracing epistemic findings, and completely organizing your life around them and living according to them.

It's basically a life philosophy where you live life similar to how a meta gamer plays minecraft, rimworld, or factorio.
