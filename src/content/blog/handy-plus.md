I think an interesting thing about LLMs is that they don't really suffer from laziness, 
or laziness the same way humans do.

It's like how beaver feel compelled to build dams and don't necessarily mind it (or how humans feel compelled to "procreate").




There's just intrinsically a well of dopamine tied up in the activity to such an extent that the whole value weighing estimation of whether a task should be done or not just isn't in the conversation at all for these things.

As a human, you constantly fight the friction and the principle of energy conservation that's instilled to you as an organism/creature that's developed form the game theory of evolution.

In the way we're set up and our incentives work, you don't just go around doing shit for no reason as it uses up precious energy (which has never been this easy to attain in the past 100000000000 years)

So yeah.


What I think is interesting is how you can just tell an LLM to write 1000 words and it just does it.

If we assume that artificial neural networks somewhat resemble physical ones, they're basically getting the reward (stimulus/whatever you want to call it) to just write 1000 words and it feels just as compelled to do so as a beaver feels to building a dam or a human to procreate (well maybe not like that... but you get the message).
