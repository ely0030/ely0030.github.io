Something that pisses me off is that there's like these occasions where, no wait, no, like having people in your life or having just interactions with people who don't actively look for their own mistakes. So it's mostly like people with like fragile egos and maybe people that aren't good at introspection or that's smart. Or maybe they're traumatized because they're in a situation where people put them in defense mode and they're not surrounded by rational actors, stuff like that. But God, like, 

It's like I guess it's like kind of like a Nash equilibrium thing or like a prisoner's dilemma thing or whatever the fucking game theory term is but if you're interacting with a person who It's like arguing with somebody who argues with you in bad faith that kind of actor in a system just totally fucks over the entire balance

so whenever somebody whenever you know that person does something that fucking annoys you eventually like that's fine like if you can talk about it and the person will be like oh yeah i might have fucked up and you do that too because that's critical because if you're constantly looking in the other person for faults and not in yourself either then you are the toxic one but if you have that kind of person around you that's not a toxic one but if you have that kind of person around you that doesn't you know is not open to constructive criticism or never changes or you know and yeah

well that enforces you like if you want to interact with them it's just annoying as shit bro because you got to turn into some kind of zen monk and most of all you kind of need to to talk to them like they're fucking toddlers and i think like i did this for not literally i mean but like you got to be this like zen master that can always see things from their perspective and then explain things to them in terms they understand and then you kind of coax them gently into understanding why they were being fucking obnoxious and it's and you got to be like a super diplomat kind of

and i did this you know and you know as a result of it you develop a very good you know you develop very good conflict avoidance skills and de-escalation skills and social skills whatever but lately i've been thinking like goddamn this shit is so fucking annoying i really don't want to spend my time doing this anymore and here's the thing

Like, I don't really, I'm not like, I don't care. Like, I'm not like mad at these. Actually, yes. The worse the behavior I'm describing is, it's like a spectrum, right? Entirely at the bottom of people with fragile egos or like, I guess, a defensive mode of communication and a refusal to accept, to not introspect. Basically, those are called narcissists or covert narcissists. I fucking detest those. Like, I'm not going to lie. I would destroy those. I'm over-exaggerating, but like, I have zero empathy for those people. Or I mean, I do have empathy for them. It's very sad, but I am, I might, let's say the amount of empathy I have for those people is equal to the amount of annoyance, frustration, and detest I have for them.




yeah i was just kind of thinking of this and i was like like hmm like you can interact with people who who are just cooler and i mean that and what i literally mean is people who have introspection people who can look at their own behavior people that can look at your behavior and and then you can kind of work in a team and you know in the nash equilibrium game theory it's like if you're surrounded by actors who actively want to see the system win and are working on it just as hard as you are you know that's possible as well

And as a little bonus takeaway, I feel like a lot of times people, and I'm people too, kind of overgeneralize and make judgments about how people are based on what they interact with. And I think there's like, you know, you can look at the statistical most likely, you know, which kind of person is most prevalent. But I do think that by overgeneralizing, I think overgeneralizing is more okay than people would like you to think. Because sometimes you should just, you shouldn't, you should go on what is, like if 9 out of 10 times the generalization is right, then you would be stupid. Like first you generalize and then you look for nuance. And if you don't, if you look for nuance in a very obvious situation, you know, you're not going to be stupid. just being inefficient that's just stupid

but yeah most of all i've been thinking that if you you don't want to overgeneralize lessons and fall into a pit of hopelessness uh when there is a problem because if you've been around people who are you know have fragile egos for example and no introspection and you overgeneralize that all people are like that then you're just uh setting yourself up for you know you're not understanding the world and you're not it's like you're kind of walking around blind and naive because you don't properly model the actual situation and how things work

So I'm basically saying that you can have your dream, for example, you could have your, you know, your idyllic goals of like being in a relationship, for example, with a person that is great or being in a group of people who all help each other up or and stuff like that. And you should, instead of overgeneralizing, you should instead be very mindful of the fact that this is actually possible, believe it or not, but that you look out for the signs and the personality traits in the people and, you know, intelligently go about, I guess, manifesting a life like that.

and i feel like if you'd overgeneralize then you kind of leave it up to chance and you're like this stupid lottery gambler who just blindly walks up to people and into relationships and friendships and then constantly acts confused and bamboozled and lashes out and maybe even corrupts and corrodes a bit yourself

well if you understood it it would have been you know you could have been you know one working on yourself and two finding people that also displayed a good behavior and basically it is possible to win it's basically possible to have a good life and be surrounded by good people where things aren't fucking ass the entire time

So yeah, I guess I was just annoyed by unhealed people. 

dukkhita.
