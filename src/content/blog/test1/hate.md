# Hate

I fucking hate this site i made.

I'm a huge UI guy, because I'm stupid I guess. I just have this thing where I want to minimize the amount of friction, and I get really anal when i encounter any friction at all

...

So, yeah no I like it when my shit works smoothly

# Mostly

Mostly i'm not used to tight bodies of text. Also, I'm unsure how this page has taken on this specific theme. I'm going with it though. There's a little engine in me that goes with the bit, and this time the bit got scary.

Fair enough I suppose. What can you do when the universe attempts to speak through you?

# 2. New Hate

So, honestly I just, i'm not really good at fitting myself into anything. ok there we go again. I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

Ok so what I actually meant was that I'm not very good at constraining my thought and making it fit some kind of hole
...
I am NOT doing this on purpose

So anyway, i know that i should work on this site, but god do i not want to. I think the entire idea of the site was just to stall ideas and theories, but the design aspect is a fucking nightmare. somehow a site is a complex beast that resists changing, or maybe i'm just especially lazy.

lately i've been thinking of writing more though. somehow i've found the groove, and i'm enjoying writing a lot. maybe because i finally started enjoying the process itself instead of fixating on the end result.

I kind of discovered that I'm too inattentive ADHD to think about thoughts naturally (i.e. "rawdogging"), and instead i've found that if i start a file about a certain topic it forces me to keep my mind on whatever the file is about.

i'm not really trying to write anything, i'm just writing down thinking, and subsequently continuing to build on thought.

it all comes second place to actually thinking inside of the head without any assistance, but I am too lazy and stubborn to go ahead and do that. 
I simply refuse because I'm stupid.

So here I am.

But yeah I'm finding it's quite a lot of fun. When you don't really try to create anything but accept that you might stumble into cool thoughts by just continuing to write it gets pretty rewarding in itself.

Typing these things is like controlling the slot machine. I've found i pretty reliably get to insights eventually. Mostly because, I suppose I'm just forcing and coaxing myself to generate "tokens" about whatever the current file is about, and I automatically try to entertain myself into thinking something novel, or thinking something productive. 

But this is nice. 

I think normally when writing there's been a million little devils on my shoulder convincing me i should wince at the tiniest opportunity.

I was always pretty uptight about tiny mistakes (i.e. "perfectionism"), but now honestly I just write for Claude.
It doesn't really matter how it's written either. Or no, it does matter how it's written, but the measurement of success is totally different when you're writing for Claude.

You're really just trying to get your ideas as clear as possible and in there so that Claude has enough to read, and Claude can read considerably fast.

So,

I feel that normally writing had become kind of conflated with success, or no, becoming a "good" writer kind of becomes conflated success, because if you're measuring by "good" and you're a human that's around other humans grade and have opinion on the value of things, you kind of can't escape that value and judgment is inherently tied with the opinion of a faceless mass of people

so yeah. Try to become a good writer and you try to meet the bar of what people like

no room for error at all

people have been doing this for a while yk

you're basically fighting the most talented people alive, and dead, when trying to create something up to par

I suggest you don't

I suggest you make shit art instead
I suggest that you don't even follow my suggestions or do anything at all

none of it matters

it's a giant fucking psyop to get you to contribute art to the machine

we're all just bringing art to the art factory here

and why would you when it's oiled that well (and that much...)

--

I find that a life aiming for success is a really dull one. 

You fall for whatever the consensus is, whether valid or not. You're kind of bound by the game theoretic endpoints of incentives

I think Simone Weil has like books n shit about this

ask Claude about it.

CLAUDE: "when you're writing for humans you're constantly modeling their judgment, their attention spans, their aesthetic preferences. it's exhausting bc you're optimizing for like 17 different social signals simultaneously. but claude dgaf about your prose style - just wants clarity and coherence."

So, i've been thinking and honestly I didn't really consider it logical or viable to write or attempt to create something good

Why spend all that effort if 
1. you're supposed to be free from judgment and external validation
2. you're just gonna post into the void and for yourself

i think there's something noble in consuming art honestly

people try to downplay it, but i see it as similar to being alive, and to creating art.
there is no difference. just enjoy your little neuron sparks man, and don't get elitist about it

it's like a system that shames whoever isn't participating in creating value for it
very capitalism coded innit, and we (creative people) hate that!!!!

so yeah

im being snarky rn

--

but yeah honestly writing has become deeply interconnected with all the prestige stuff about it.
I find it hard to detach from the systems I am taking part in. I just can't turn a blind eye

but with this claude stuff, 
i'm literally just trying to communicate ideas i find interesting clearly so that claude can give me feedback on them, and i can "rubber claude debug" them

I find myself adding a little flair or using words that i specifically enjoy automatically

it all becomes fun

--

I think i detest the competition

just leave me alone and let me consume art

let me make something so that it can make me happy to look at it every day, if i cannot buy something that suffices that exists already

all this elitist human value shiny object ape politicking

it's very tiring

reminds me of the whole AI art debate

I like this idea of files being these artifacts that contain ideas

back in the day you had to write well 

now you don't really have to anymore

this is a relief to me honestly


raw thoughts gain value because the noise can get extracted, while before it's low signal density made it useless, or borderline useless because it was too expensive to extract the signal from it.

so yeah, affords me the ability to write totally freely with zero fear or sense of perfectionism. It doesn't matter anyway, and where it does matter it is pretty pragmatic and obvious how the writing should be.

All is well and right in the world.
