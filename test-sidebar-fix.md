# Sidebar Fix Test Results

## Issue
The Home and About links in the sidebar were jumping when switching between different page types (index vs literature/literature2/literature3).

## Root Cause
- The standard `.layout-wrapper` has `padding: 1.5em 0.8em` 
- The `.sidebar` has `margin-top: -0.8em` to compensate and move links higher
- But page-type-specific layouts (literature, literature2, literature3) were overriding with `padding: 15px 0 30px` which removed the top padding
- This caused the sidebar to jump because the negative margin was no longer compensating for the wrapper's top padding

## Fix Applied
Changed all literature page type layout-wrapper styles to maintain consistent top padding:
- `body.literature .layout-wrapper`: Changed from `15px` to `1.5em` top padding
- `body.literature2 .layout-wrapper`: Changed from `15px` to `1.5em` top padding  
- `body.literature3 .layout-wrapper`: Changed from `15px` to `1.5em` top padding
- Also fixed the responsive media query overrides for consistency

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Visit http://localhost:4322/ (index page)
2. Click on any blog post with literature/literature2/literature3 page type
3. The Home and About links should now stay in the same position without jumping

## Files Modified
- `/src/styles/global.css` - Updated layout-wrapper padding for all literature page types
