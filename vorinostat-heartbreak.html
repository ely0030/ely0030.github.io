        <h1>Question: Can Vorinostat Help Heartbreak?</h1>
        
        <p>Based on the provided notes, there is evidence suggesting that vorinostat may indeed help with heartbreak and emotional recovery from relationship issues. Here are the key points supporting this:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Vorinostat - Page 9 - Brain Health - LONGECITY</strong> reports a user's experience where vorinostat helped reduce the emotional pain associated with a past relationship:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Unbidden, a memory of the girl I'd dated 5 months before floated to my mind. And for the first time in all those months, I could feel it lose its emotional salience. The pain was dulled. I ran into her a few weeks later, and, for the first time since our first kiss, I wasn't flustered and rendered stupid by her mere proximity."
                </blockquote>

            <li>
                <p><strong>Vorinostat - Page 11 - Brain Health - LONGECITY</strong> provides another user's account:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "My best experience so far (same with StevesPetRat) was to get over a serious relationship with not too much pain, I was surprised both of the strong anxiolytic effects I got with 50mg, continuing with a dose every other day for 300mg in total I was in a state that I will probably need more than a couple months to get not thinking about it, been in a low mood."

            <li>
                <p><strong>Vorinostat - Page 10 - Brain Health - LONGECITY</strong> mentions:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "It seems to have a strong effect in 'dating anxiety' for me, both in asking girls out for a date, and feeling far calmer when my last relationship ended, in a similar fashion to StevesPetRat's description before."
                </blockquote>

            </li>

            <li>
                <p><strong>Vorinostat/rNootropics - [NSFW] Article on HDAC Inhibitors</strong> explains the mechanism:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "When you take an HDAC inhibitor and 'get rid of' a fearful memory, you're actually not getting rid of it, you're downplaying it. The present is prioritized, overshadowing any grossly inflated fear memories."
                </blockquote>
                <p>This mechanism could apply to the emotional pain of heartbreak as well.</p>

            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>It's important to note that individual experiences may vary, and vorinostat should be used carefully and under proper guidance. The dosage and frequency mentioned in these anecdotes (50-300mg, with varying intervals) should not be taken as medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional before using any medication for off-label purposes.</p>
