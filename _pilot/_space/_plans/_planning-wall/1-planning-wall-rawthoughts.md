- Ability to double click on an empty card spot and make a new card that way



- right now when a card gets vertically lower, in the vertical row the slots underneath that card go lower. this is very good.
a problem is that the slots to the left and right of it also get lower vertically when there's space for the card to go directly underneath a card there vertically

Can you make it so that the changes to the grid are contained within their vertical rows?
