# Security & HTTPS Setup Verification Complete

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Status**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

## What Was Verified and Completed

### 1. HTTPS Infrastructure (miniPC work) ✅
- **SSL Certificates**: Generated and stored in `/certs/` directory
- **HTTPS Proxy**: `https-proxy.js` created and configured
- **Windows Scripts**: Updated to use secure server
  - `host-network-https.ps1` - Main PowerShell orchestrator
  - `start-https-server.bat` - One-click launcher
- **Old Scripts Removed**: `host-network.ps1` and `start-servers.bat` deleted

### 2. Authentication Backend ✅
- **Secure Server**: `blog-save-server-secure.js` properly integrated
- **Environment File**: `.env` created with password
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **Path Protection**: Prevents directory traversal attacks

### 3. Frontend Authentication (completed by me) ✅
- **Auth Manager**: Full authentication class integrated into notepad.astro
- **Login Modal**: HTML already present, JavaScript now connected
- **API Integration**: All save/delete operations now require authentication
- **Event Handlers**: Login button, Enter key, and Escape key all working

### 4. Unix Script Update ✅
- **run-dev.sh**: Updated to use `blog-save-server-secure.js`

## Current Security State

### Protected ✅
- All blog save/delete operations require password
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Path traversal attacks blocked
- HTTPS encryption for network traffic (when using Windows scripts)

### Not Protected (by design)
- Reading blog posts (public by design)
- Individual post passwords (separate feature)

## How to Use

### Windows (miniPC)
```batch
start-https-server.bat
```
Then navigate to https://localhost:4321

### Unix/Mac
```bash
./run-dev.sh
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:4321

### First Time Use
1. Go to `/notepad`
2. Try to save a post
3. Enter password from `.env` file
4. Token stored in browser for future saves

## Files Changed Summary

**Created**:
- `/certs/cert.pem` & `/certs/key.pem`
- `/.env` (with password)
- `/SECURITY-VERIFICATION-COMPLETE.md` (this file)

**Modified**:
- `/src/pages/notepad.astro` - Added full auth integration
- `/run-dev.sh` - Updated to use secure server

**Already Done by miniPC**:
- `/https-proxy.js`
